# Project Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document details the refactoring of the Write2Learn project structure according to the best practices outlined in `global-rules.md`. The goal was to improve code organization, maintainability, and modularity without changing any functionality.

## Key Changes

### Directory Structure

The project now follows a clearer, feature-based organization:

- **app/** - Next.js App Router pages and routes (unchanged)
- **components/** - Organized by feature (auth, journal, onboarding, etc.)
- **services/** - API and external service interactions
  - **api/** - Feature-specific API calls
  - **supabase/** - Supabase client configuration
- **stores/** - State management (converted from contexts)
- **hooks/** - Custom React hooks organized by feature
- **utils/** - Pure utility functions
- **types/** - TypeScript type definitions by feature
- **docs/** - Documentation files
- **config/** - Configuration files
- **public/** - Static assets (unchanged)
- **tests/** - Tests mirroring the app structure (unchanged)

### Authentication Flow

- Auth services moved to `services/api/auth-service.ts`
- Auth context converted to store pattern in `stores/auth-store.tsx`
- Custom auth hooks extracted to `hooks/auth/use-auth.ts`
- Auth components moved to `components/auth/*`

### UI and Utilities

- UI utilities moved to `utils/ui.ts`
- Date formatting functions in `utils/date-utils.ts`
- Input validation in `utils/validation.ts`
- Webhook functionality in `utils/webhook.ts`

### Favicon and Logo Consistency

- Using SVG logo consistently across the app

## Benefits

1. **Better separation of concerns** - Clear boundaries between UI, logic, and data
2. **Feature-focused organization** - Related code is grouped together
3. **Improved discoverability** - Easier to find relevant code
4. **More maintainable** - Smaller, more focused files

## Future Improvements

- Complete migration of all contexts to stores
- Add detailed documentation for each feature area
- Improve test coverage across the refactored structure
