# Landing Page Documentation

## Overview

The landing page serves as the entry point to the Write2Learn application. It follows a mobile-first approach and is built using Next.js App Router and Tailwind CSS. The landing page is designed to be responsive, visually appealing, and provide clear navigation to the authentication flow.

## Component Architecture

The landing page is built using several reusable components:

1. **Header**: Navigation bar with logo and authentication buttons
2. **Hero**: Main banner with value proposition and call-to-action
3. **Section**: Reusable container for different page sections
4. **FeatureCard**: Display key application features
5. **StepItem**: Visualize workflow steps
6. **Footer**: Contains links and copyright information

## File Structure

```
/app/
  page.tsx                 # Main landing page component

/components/landing/
  feature-card.tsx         # Display application features
  footer.tsx               # Page footer
  header.tsx               # Navigation header
  hero.tsx                 # Hero section with main CTA
  section.tsx              # Reusable section container
  step-item.tsx            # Workflow step visualization

/tests/components/landing/
  landing-components.test.tsx  # Tests for individual components
  landing-page.test.tsx        # Tests for the full landing page
```

## Usage

### Landing Page

The main page component (`/app/page.tsx`) serves as the composition layer, importing and arranging all the necessary components:

```tsx
import { Header } from '@/components/landing/header';
import { Hero } from '@/components/landing/hero';
import { Section } from '@/components/landing/section';
import { FeatureCard } from '@/components/landing/feature-card';
import { StepItem } from '@/components/landing/step-item';
import { Footer } from '@/components/landing/footer';

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
      <Header />
      <Hero />
      <Section title="What Can You do?">
        {/* Feature cards */}
      </Section>
      <Section title="How It Works">
        {/* Step items */}
      </Section>
      <Footer />
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Responsive Design

The landing page uses the `useResponsive` hook for consistent responsive behavior:

```tsx
import { useResponsive } from '@/hooks/common/use-responsive';

function MyComponent() {
  const { isMobile, isDesktop } = useResponsive();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isMobile ? (
        <MobileLayout />
      ) : (
        <DesktopLayout />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing

The landing page components have comprehensive tests covering:

1. **Expected use cases**: Normal rendering with props
2. **Edge cases**: Various prop combinations
3. **Failure cases**: Missing props or unexpected data

## Authentication Flow

The landing page connects to the authentication flow through the Header component, which contains "Sign In" and "Register" buttons linking to the auth page. This creates a seamless user journey from initial visit to account creation.

## Styling

The landing page follows the application's global styling guidelines:

- Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- Tailwind CSS for utility classes
- Consistent color scheme and typography
- Component-level styling when needed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the landing page:

1. Add animations for smoother transitions
2. Implement internationalization (i18n) for multi-language support
3. Add testimonials section
4. Implement A/B testing for different layouts
5. Add more interactive elements for better engagement
