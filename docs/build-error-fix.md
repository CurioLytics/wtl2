# Build Error Fix and Refactoring Cleanup

## Issue Fixed
Fixed the build error related to missing module `@/lib/utils` by updating import paths:

- Changed import path in `components/ui/button.tsx` from `@/lib/utils` to `@/utils/ui`

## Previous Refactoring Summary

During the project restructuring, we:

1. Moved utility functions:
   - `lib/utils.ts` → `utils/ui.ts` 
   - `lib/webhook.ts` → `utils/webhook.ts`
   - `lib/auth.ts` → `services/api/auth-service.ts`
   - `lib/supabase.ts` → `services/supabase/client.ts`

2. Reorganized component structure:
   - Moved auth components to `components/auth/`
   - Organized components by feature

3. Established proper boundaries:
   - Created `services/` for API interactions
   - Created `stores/` for state management
   - Created `hooks/` for reusable logic

4. Removed redundant files:
   - Deleted original files after moving them
   - Removed empty directories

## Next Steps

1. Run the application locally to verify that all functionality works as expected
2. Update any remaining imports that might be missed
3. Continue adding features following the new structure
